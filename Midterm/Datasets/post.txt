Thousands of farmers clashed with police as protesters on the outskirts of the city forced their way in.

One protester died, and more than 300 police officers were injured.

Blaming the chaos on rogue elements among an otherwise peaceful march, most farmers' leaders said they would not call off their protests.

Those detained are being held on charges of rioting, damaging public property, and attacking police personnel. So far, 22 police complaints have been registered.
